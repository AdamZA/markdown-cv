## Goals

My growth at Oracle has given me a lot of exposure to infrastructure, dev-ops and
front-end tasks, with less back-end exposure. I’ve typically been working within estab-
lished patterns and libraries without building much from scratch. I’d like to round out
my skills by getting to build new things, in new frameworks, as well as being exposed to
more back-end development again.

## Work Experience

`Jan 2020-Present`
__IC2/IC3 Software Developer__, Oracle

I initially joined the Oracle Cloud team working on a migration service which aimed to
help customers to move their infrastructure configuration onto newer equivalent product
offerings. Following this project, I have also worked on an infrastructure visualization service,
a service to integrate Oracle Cloud with external cloud providers, and more recently on
various on-premises offerings which emulate the cloud UX. My primary contributions have
been in the form of devops, such as designing the cloud infrastructure architecture, handling
deployments, new region releases, and general compliance asks - primarily making use of
Terraform (via Shepherd, Oracle’s internal Terraform manager), Ansible/Bash, Python and
Docker. I’ve also done a variety of front-end work for the Oracle Cloud Console, using
React/Typescript based internal frameworks, including addressing accessibility concerns to
conform to VPAT standard. I’ve generally been exposed to designing at scale using tools
such as Load Balancers, Workflow As A Service, Deployment Orchestrators, etc. In terms
of back-end exposure, other than integration, my main contributions have been feature
implementations and adjustments based on provided yaml spec changes.

`July 2016-December 2019`
__Intermediate Software Developer__, Full Stack

A start-up focused on delivering Web and Mobile projects to clients. C#/.Net Framework
and Xamarin were the primary tools used in these projects. Dependency injection, unit
testing, source control, and Agile development were used extensively. I began as a junior
developer, receiving guidance until I was exposed to enough technologies in order to start
guiding others. I then led smaller teams on new projects, while also working with the product
owner and architect in order to construct backlogs.

`Jan - May 2016`
__Software and Game Developer__, Sea Monster

Creating Augmented Reality apps for clients, on both Android and iOS, using Unity3D with
C#. I worked with both artists and devs in order to deliver on a variety of smaller projects.
