## Goals

My growth at Oracle has given me opportunities to work on a variety of services: contributing to the API, front-end, dev-ops/infrastructural requirements, and debugging/resolving live services issues. That said, I've typically been working within established patterns and libraries without building much from scratch. Existing internal documentation and references are extensive. I'd like to deepen my understanding with an environment change, by applying fundamentals with unfamiliar technologies/frameworks while upskilling and delivering. I've also found enjoyment in dev-ops and infrastructure responsibilities - as it empowers me when assisting with live service issues and minimizing customer impact, which I find rewarding. I'd like the opportunity to further grow in this space.

## Work

`2020-Present`
__IC3 Software Developer__, Oracle

I joined Oracle Cloud at the start of 2020 as an IC2, looking to challenge myself and grow in the Cloud space. Within a few months, there was an unexpected permanent transition to full-time remote work-from-home. Despite this, I adapted and delivered, resulting in me being elevated to an IC3 role. I've contributed to a variety of services, but my primary ownership and delivery has been in dev-ops and infrastructure, and in assisting with on-call requirements (triaging live-service issues). 
<br />
- Initially assisted with enhancing/maintaining the existing UI and backend of a Migration Service, which helped customers to move their existing infrastructure configurations onto newer equivalent product offerings.
- Service required knowledge with bash, ansible, Docker, Java, Python, TypeScript, React, Terraform and a variety of internal tools.
- On-call duties required me to leverage metrics, internal logs, SSHing and debugging on the host, and communicate with relevant parties while triaging service errors.
- Assisted in migrating the existing project Terraform into a new internal Terraform wrapper tool, which helped me to learn Cloud service architecture.
- Following this, my team moved on to an Infrastructure Vizualization tool, where I led the delivery of infrastructural requirements. This included leveraging Terraform to stand up our VCNs, Subnets (incl. Gateways, Sec lists/Ingress and Egress rules), Load Balancers, registering the DNS, instance configurations (and subsequent instances), deployment pipelines and build service integration, Workflow as a Service, Databases, Whitelists, metrics and alarms, Bastions, etc.
- Once required infrastructure delivered so that developers could deploy, test and deliver changes, the team moved again onto a Multicloud Service - aiming to integrate Oracle Cloud with external cloud providers.
- Worked on a tight deadline to prepare new environments and infrastructure for new service, as well as onboarded to larger-scale deployment automation pipelines (leveraging capabilities), also requiring deployments to government and disconnected realms with stricter internal change requirements for release.
- Worked through CSSAP compliance requirements for infrastructure leading up to GA.
- Moved to new service team following service GA. This service aims to emulate and integrate with Cloud services but in a disconnected, on-prem package delivering the same UX. My team's focus was on the UX and front-end requirements for both the on-device and Cloud Console UI for this service. 
- Was exposed to React/TypeScript based internal frameworks, VPAT requirement and Figma wireframing, while owning and maintaining deployments/whitelists/releases in new regions.
- Moved to similar product in the service family, using different internal template-based frameworks while delivering similar responsibilities in terms of new region releases.

I currently continue to balance front-end deliverables with infrastructure/operational tasks, while assisting in the maintenance and on-call requirements of older services.

`2016-2019`
__Intermediate Software Developer__, Full Stack

A start-up focused on delivering Web and Mobile solutions for clients. I worked here for 3 and a half years, skilling up from a junior to intermediate developer. Built foundational knowledge of RESTful APIs, back-end and front-end project structures, mobile projects, CI/CD, databases, and leveraging Cloud services along with Microservice architecture and queues.
<br />
- Worked as a fullstack developer, getting exposure to large variety of technologies.
- SOLID principles, Dependency Injection, Source Control and Agile development used extensively
- Backend: C# with .Net Framework, hosted on Azure Cloud, SQL
- Frontend: Angular with TypeScript
- Mobile: Xamarin
- Worked with Product Owners in order to help convert customer requirements into actionable backlogs in Jira.

`2016`
__Software and Game Developer__, Sea Monster

I worked at Sea Monster for 5 months after graduating, which was an animation studio which recently expanded to include a games development startup in order to expand client offerings.
<br />

- Engine: Unity3D with C#
